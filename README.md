# TToast
This is a simple javascript library to create a toast in a web. Still under development but you can use it now.

# How To Use
1. Download js files and include it to your project. (ex. in index.html)
2. To show a toast, use this code:

```
TToast({
  text: 'Your text',
  position: 'bottom|center', //top, middle, bottom | left, center, right
  color: 'Font Color',
  background: 'Background color',
})
```
Ps: You can use the default TToast style. Therefore, you can use the `text` and `position` properties.
